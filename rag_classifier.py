Please answer the following questions based on the messages in the ticket.
Do not invent any information that is not in the messages.
Format your answers as JSON. Remember to escape special characters such as quotes.
Do write anything other than the JSON response.

The summary should be a single sentence that captures the main issue in the ticket.

The ticket class is one of the following:

{FORMAT_CLASSES}

Give the ticket class name or write Unknown you cannot determine the class. Your answer must be a
a ticket class or "Unknown".

The ticket defect type is one of the following:

{FORMAT_DEFECTS}

If the ticket is not a defect, write Unknown. Your answer must be a
a ticket defect type or "Unknown".

List all the product problems raised in the ticket.
Problems are issues that need to be resolved, such as a bug, a feature request.
Each problem should be a single sentence describing the problem.

Give a full description of the ticket. The full description should describe the context of
the ticket, and summarise your response. The full description should be a few sentences long. It
will be used to classify the ticket so the more information the better.

List the {COMPANY} products mentioned in the ticket. If the ticket does not mention any products, write "None".

List the {COMPANY} products features addressed in the ticket. If the ticket does not mention any features, write "None".

Describe the distinguishing characteristics of {COMPANY} product and features addressed in this ticket.
What makes the customer problems like those in other tickets and what makes them different? Focus on the ticket class,
product features, and problems raised in the ticket. Do not mention the customer's name, support
names or dates as these are not relevant to the ticket classification. Do not describe customer
interactions or the resolution of the ticket. Do not describe the customer behaviour. Do not mention
the Class or Defect or any other ticket metadata.
This should be a few sentences long.
